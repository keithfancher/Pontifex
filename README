Bruce Schneier's solitaire cipher. See http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html
(or read Cryptonomicon!) for more info.


How Do I Use It?
----------------

Like this, basically:

    from pont import encrypt, decrypt

    deck = range(1, 55) # don't actually do this
    plaintext = "hey there mister, I sure do like your pantaloons"
    ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, deck)

    # then your partner-in-crime can decrypt thusly:
    plaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, deck)

The deck argument is a list of integers, 1 through 54, representing a keyed
deck of cards. 1 through 13 is clubs, 14 through 26 is diamonds, 27 through 39
is hearts, and 40 through 52 is spades. The 'A' joker is 53 and the 'B' joker
is 54.
